The Internet of things is an emerging technology incorporated into every part of human life. Biomedical signals of the devices can provide information about an individual's health which can
detect the patient heart rate, Blood Oxygen level (SpO2), CO2, temperature, and blood pressure. IoT technology helps the health authorities
segregate the patients who require immediate treatment using the sensor values and send the alert to doctors.
